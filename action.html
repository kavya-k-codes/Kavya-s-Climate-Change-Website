    <h1>How do we fight climate challenge?</h1>
  <p class="txtAlign"><mark><b>Changes you can apply to your life:</b></mark> Have you ever seen “smoke” coming out of cars? This is the release of toxic air pollutants like CO, sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide. An alternative to this vehicle is using an electric car or biking or walking for shorter distances. Additionally, it’s good to conserve water and compost the food you don’t eat due to the amount of droughts there are and food scarcity from intense weather. Compost is great for soil. Consider using solar panels to power your home. Renewable energy like this is so much better for the environment and, as a bonus, it will never run out!  </p>
    

    <p class="txtAlign"><mark><b>What you can do with others:</b></mark> While costly, the Green New Deal is one that can save our planet. It calls for clean (renewable) energy use over fossil fuels and greenhouse gas emissions and will create more jobs in the green industry. You can sign petitions for the Green New Deal and spread awareness to the people around you. Attending peaceful protests is another good way to get the point across. Be loud for the use of renewable energy with solar panels, biomass from plants, hydropower from running water and wind energy from windmills. We must adapt to the problem, but not get comfortable.</p>
