    <p class="textAlignImg"><b>Purpose:</b> This website is to inform people on the crisis going on in our planet. We hope to educate people who in turn can sign for politicians to push a policy such as the Green New Deal and/or spread awareness to their peers. This is a global problem. </p>

    <p class="textAlignImg"><b>Causes:</b> Global warming is caused by the release of greenhouse gas emissions which trap heat and radiate it back to the Earth in the form of infrared heat. While the greenhouse  effect is vital, humans have increased the amount of emissions in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. CO2, methane, NO2 and chlorofluorocarbons, which can all come from industrial use or burning are the four main contributing.

    <p class="textAlignImg"><b>Effects:</b> Due to higher temperatures, glaciers and ice caps are melting. The sea level has risen 8 inches since 1880. There have been and will continue to be more droughts, heat waves, wildfires and other extreme weather. Hurricanes and flooding occur more intensely. Itâ€™s predicted that the arctic will be completely void of ice, killing thousands of arctic animals. Source: <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/ ">NASA</a>
